## Architecture

The application uses the [dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) to inject I/O, making the application easier and faster to test.

The service layer depends on an abstraction. For testing, it is passed a fake implementation of I/O. We can test the application "edge-to-edge" with fast, in-memory unit tests.

---

For real-world, the service layer is passed real I/O that talks to a database. We've already exhaustively tested the service layer in-memory, so fewer e2e and integration tests are needed.
